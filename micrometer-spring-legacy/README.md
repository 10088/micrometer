# Spring Bindings for Micrometer

## Deprecation Notice
**Now that Spring Boot 1.x support is End Of Life, this module is deprecated and will be removed. Upgrade to Spring Boot 2.x to continue using supported versions of Micrometer with Spring.**

---

This project contains Spring-specific configurations and support that help
you to create a well-instrumented Spring 4.x or Spring Boot 1.x application with a
minimum amount of boilerplate.

As of Spring 5 / Spring Boot 2, a dependency on this module is 
unnecessary, as the Spring Boot metrics system is based on Micrometer 
and all necessary configuration is present in Spring Boot itself.
